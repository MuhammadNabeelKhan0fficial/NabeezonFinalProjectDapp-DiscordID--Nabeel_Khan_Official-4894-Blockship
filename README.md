* Hey Sir Nabeel here !
* This is the project of Digital Assets store which i makes in around 20 days in 6 to 7 turn because i was facing several problems...
* So Here the start I am also facing the problem of publishing a whole project in github repo so it is bad news for you beacuse you can't run it without doin so much thing
* First of all you have to download Node.js LTS version for it and for deployement of our coin contract in by using hardhat because hardhat supports only LTS version of it
* Then you have to create next.js app I used terminal for it Search it and see all the npm and npx command to start a next.js app project
* Then Download all the dependencies which are in Package.json file first download tailwindCss and also do little config in styles/golbalCss file as i did...
* Then Use Moralis database to store user Id ,ethadessess, product price , product url , product name must etc...
* Then use Moralis serverUrl and Application ID and store it in customize file named .env as i did...
* Then it is optional to use Netlify for deployemnt of our project and remain to Site progresssing in development ...
* Go to project and make a folder smart-contract and used a proper openzeppelin based ERC20 token to create coin for our app which is used to buy assets from store..
* Download all the customize folder and files form this repo like Componenet ,Pages, libs, Assets ,Products and context ...
* After all the configuration Type in command palette (npm run dev) And click clt+click on htttp:Localhost3000.com to see our running app :D
